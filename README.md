School project website for DL Powered Pests and Disease Detection in Maize.
DL POWERED PEST AND DISEASE IDENTIFICATION AND REMEDY RECOMMENDATION IN MAIZE

Abstract:
The project focuses on developing a Deep Learning (DL)-powered system for identifying pests and diseases in maize plants, providing timely recommendations for effective remedies. With agriculture's vital role in Kenya's economy, the innovative solution aims to overcome challenges in traditional visual observation methods by leveraging DL and machine learning techniques. The system employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a diverse dataset to classify and identify plant issues accurately. Additionally, a comprehensive database of remedies enhances the system's capabilities, contributing to proactive plant health management.

Model Deployment:
After successful training, the DL-based model is deployed through two channels:

Website Deployment: The user-friendly website allows farmers to capture images of affected maize leaves for analysis. The trained CNN processes uploaded images, identifies issues, and provides tailored recommendations. The website extends its capabilities to video processing, enabling dynamic pest and disease identification.


Nvidia Jetson Nano Deployment: The compact edge computing device facilitates real-time image capture and analysis in the field. The Nvidia Jetson Nano's on-the-spot processing empowers immediate decision-making for proactive plant health management, ensuring timely interventions.


Conclusion:
The YOLOv8 model's analysis reveals enhanced precision and accuracy, offering a reliable tool for early detection of maize plant issues. While acknowledging success, the project outlines recommendations for dataset enhancement, addressing class imbalances, and continuous system improvement. The project's impact extends to sustainable farming practices, improved crop productivity, and enhanced food security. Future endeavors involve refining the system's performance, exploring diverse crop applications, and integrating emerging technologies for real-time monitoring.

Areas for Further Study:

Dataset Enhancement: Improve diversity and address class imbalances.
Database Expansion: Continuously update the pest and disease database.
Advanced AI Techniques: Explore cutting-edge AI technologies for refinement.
IoT Monitoring Enhancements: Integrate real-time monitoring improvements.
Collaboration: Engage with agronomists for real-world insights.
The project lays the groundwork for advancing agricultural technology, contributing to global food supply chain resilience and sustainability.
